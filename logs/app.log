[2025-06-19 22:41:07,080] INFO - [LLM Raw Output] The data provided is related to patients who have had a stroke or are at risk of having one. The data includes information about the patients' demographics, health conditions, and lifestyle factors. 

The data is divided into several categories, including:

* Demographics: gender, age, and residence type
* Health conditions: hypertension, heart disease, and stroke
* Lifestyle factors: ever married, work type, average glucose level, body mass index (bmi), and smoking status

The data is useful for understanding the relationships between these factors and the risk of having a stroke. For example, it might be interesting to see how smoking status affects the risk of having a stroke, or how body mass index is related to the risk of having a stroke.

If you would like to explore this data further, I can help you with that.
